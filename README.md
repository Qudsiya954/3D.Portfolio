🎯 Project Description: 3D Portfolio Website using React + Vite
This project is a fully responsive 3D portfolio website developed using React and Vite, showcasing modern web development techniques with an engaging user experience. It serves as a personal and professional profile, highlighting my skills as a Computer Engineering student with a strong foundation in Web Development and a keen interest in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

At the core of this portfolio lies a captivating 3D animated experience created with React Three Fiber, a powerful library for building 3D scenes in React using WebGL. The centerpiece of the homepage features a floating 3D astronaut model, dynamically rendered and animated to enhance visual appeal. This model is loaded using the GLTF/GLB format and animated using @react-three/drei and @react-three/fiber, offering an interactive and modern aesthetic that sets this portfolio apart.

The application is built using Vite, a fast build tool and development server that significantly improves development speed and Hot Module Replacement (HMR). React components are modularized and optimized for reusability and scalability. The layout is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices — from desktops to mobile phones.

The portfolio contains multiple sections:

Hero Section: Features animated text and the 3D astronaut component against a dynamic background using a parallax effect.

About Me: Briefly describes my background, education, and interests in software engineering and machine learning.

Projects: A showcase of my recent work with links to GitHub repositories and live demos.

Skills: A list of technical skills including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Git, and a growing proficiency in Python and AI/ML tools.

Contact: A form through which visitors can reach out, integrated using EmailJS or similar services.

In terms of technology stack, the project leverages:

React: Component-based architecture for building user interfaces.

Vite: Lightning-fast build tool for React development.

React Three Fiber: For integrating 3D models into the React ecosystem.

@react-three/drei: For simplifying 3D rendering and animations.

GLTF/GLB: For efficient 3D asset loading.

Tailwind CSS or custom CSS: For responsive and modern UI design.

TypeScript (optional but recommended): For type-safe coding as the project grows in complexity.

The goal of this project is not just to build a portfolio, but to demonstrate the integration of advanced technologies like WebGL and 3D modeling in a React environment. It reflects a strong grasp of both frontend development principles and creative UI/UX design.
